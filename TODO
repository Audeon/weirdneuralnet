# TODO
### Refactoring
 * implement network traversal using input & output sites instead of just node indices (high priority)
   * implement auto-regressive connections/training
   * implement dual-input node (with & without scaling)
 * parameterize priming with number of far points [UNTESTED]
 * break up experiments & package into separate modules [DONE]

### New Features
 * implement more dataset usage (high priority)
 * implement subset selection methods
   * random pick [DONE]
   * core subset
   * LTS - maybe
 * implement model structure "DNA" encoding
 * impl transfer training
 * impl network compilation [INCOMPLETE] 
   * ...actually, this may not be reasonable
 * clean up CLI
 * implement more initialization types

### Experiments
 * write up experimental procedure and results [DONE]
   * more work needed
 * fix pretraining experiment functions [DONE]
 * re-run experiments using convergence target [UNTESTED]
    * create graphics for experimental accuracy results
    * compare to other subset selection methods

### Documentation
 * document existing code [REDO]
 * document how to use WNN class
 * document how to subclass Nodes
